# OMCompiler C Runtime - Developer Documentation

The C Runtime of the OpenModelica Compiler is a runtime to work with generated C
code for a simulate ODE/DAE systems generated by the Frontend and Backend and
the Templates.

## Directory Structure

  - [dataReconciliation/](./dataReconciliation/)

    Data Reconciliation, see
    [User's Guide chapter Data Reconciliation](https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/dataReconciliation.html#data-reconciliation)

    Integrated into the simulation procedure of the C runtime. C++ code written
    in mainly C style (structs instead of classes) but using a few standard
    functionalities from the C++ standard like `vector` or `string`. Uses LAPACK
    for its Matrix/Vector computations.

  - [fmi/](./fmi/)

    Wrappers for FMI1 and FMI2 C-functions to be called from Modelica external
    C. Used by the compiler for the mostly not working FMU import in Modelica to
    integrate FMUs into a Modelica model.

  - [gc/](./gc/)

    Boehm GC mark-and-sweep garbage collector for the C runtime. Is used for C
    variables the runtime doesn't know the lifetime of. E.g. for some strings or arrays.

  - [linearization/](./linearization/)

    Single function `linearize` to linearize an ODE system. Written in C++ to
    use Strings, but otherwise using C style.

  - [math-support/](./math-support/)

    Only containts a function to compute a full pivotization of a matrix. Used for state selection.

  - [meta/](./meta/)

    C functions used for Meta Modelica. Data types or functions used in the Meta Modelica language used by Frontend / Backend of OMC.

  - [moo/](./moo/)

    Modelica / Model Optimizer - A Generic Framework for Dynamic Optimization, see
    [AMIT-HSBI/MOO](https://github.com/AMIT-HSBI/MOO).

  - [optimization/](./optimization/)

    A dynamic optimization runtime for OpenModelica, see
    [User's Guide on Optimization with OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/latest/optimization.html#builtin-dynamic-optimization)

  - [simulation/](./simulation/)

    The main simulation runtime for generated simulation executables. Containing ODE, DAE solvers as well
    as linear and non-linear solvers and tools for event handling.

  - [util](./util/)

    A lot of different functions for all parts of the C runtime.

    - C implementation of some data types like arrays, lists, strings, ...
    - Math functions for rational numbers, greatest common divisor
    - Memory management with a ringbuffer.
    - Error handling and logging.
    - Handling of CSV- and MAT-files.
    - A Java interface of all things.
