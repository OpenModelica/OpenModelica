  package:     Connect
  description: Connection set management


  Connections generate connection sets which are stored in the Sets type, which
  is then used to generate equations and evaluate stream operators during
  instantiation.

  Whenever a connection is instantiated by InstSection.connectComponents it is
  added to the connection sets with addConnection or addArrayConnection. The
  connector elements are stored in a trie, a.k.a. a prefix tree, where each node
  represents a part of the elements component reference. The connection sets
  are not stored explicitly, but each element keeps track of which set it
  belongs to. Adding a new element to a set simply means assigning the element a
  set index. Sets are not merged while connections are added either, instead a
  list of set connections are kept.

  The sets are collected and merged only when it's time to generate equations
  from them in Inst.instClass. The elements are then bucket sorted into an
  array, with pointers between buckets representing the set connections, and
  then equations are generated for each resulting set. The stream operators
  inStream and actualStream are also evaluated in the DAE at the same time,
  since they need the same data as the equation generation.

   generating equations for flow variables, where outside connectors are
   multiplied with -1 (since flow is always into a component)."
