Translation guide for OpenModelica kernel.
See the OMEdit directory for instructions on how to translate the GUI.
They are different projects and use different libraries to handle the
translations. The kernel uses gettext (libintl).

# Setup a new translation target
make update
msginit --locale=sv_SE.utf8 -i openmodelica.pot
git add sv.po

# Edit the .po-file using your favorite gettext po-file editor
# Maybe linguist (same as for OMEdit), gtranslate, or poedit.
# Maybe something else entirely

# To update a translation file
msgmerge -U sv.po openmodelica.pot
# or to merge all files (might screw other translators)
make merge-all

# To install the files to the build directory
make
# To test the settings
omc +locale=sv_SE.UTF-8 ???.{mo,mos}
Or omit +locale if your environment is already set

Note: The files are not yet installed automatically because they do not
contain translations.
