Transmission Line Modeling (TLM) Based Co-Simulation
====================================================

This chapter gives a short description how to get started using the TLM-Based
co-simulation in OMEdit. We introduce a graphical MetaModel editor which is an
extension and specialization of the OpenModelica connection editor OMEdit.

In the context of this work a MetaModel is composed of several sub-models including
the interconnections between these sub-models. The standard way to store a MetaModel
for a TLM based co-simulation is in XML format. The XML schema standard is accessible from
`tlmModelDescription.xsd <https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMEdit/blob/master/OMEdit/OMEditGUI/Resources/XMLSchema/tlmModelDescription.xsd>`__.

The full graphical functionality of the MetaModel editor for TLM Based co-simulation
provides the following general functionalities:

-  Import and add External non-Modelica models such as **Matlab/SimuLink**, **Adams**, and **BEAST** models

-  External Modelica models such as **Dymola** and **Wolfram SystemModeler** models

-  Specify startup methods and interfaces of the external model

-  Build the MetaModels by connecting the external models

-  Set the co-simulation parameters in the MetaModel

-  Simulate the MetaModels using TLM based co-simulation

Co-Simulating an Existing MetaModel
-----------------------------------
This section demonstrates how to load an existing double pendulum
MetaModel,co-simulate it, and look at the results using OMEdit.

Loading a MetaModel for Co-Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will use the "Double pendulum" MetaModel which is a multibody system that
consists of three sub-models: Two OpenModelica **Shaft** sub-models (**Shaft1**
and **Shaft2**) and one **SKF/BEAST bearing** sub-model that together build a
double pendulum. The **SKF/BEAST bearing** sub-model is a simplified model with
only three balls to speed up the simulation.**Shaft1** is connected with a
spherical joint to the world coordinate system. The end of **Shaft1** is
connected via a TLM interface to the outer ring of the BEAST bearing model. The
inner ring of the bearing model is connected via another TLM interface to
**Shaft2**. Together they build the double pendulum with two **shafts**, one
spherical OpenModelica joint, and one BEAST bearing.

To load the double pendulum MetaModel, select **File > Open MetaModel** from the
menu and select pendulum.xml.

OMEdit starts loading the MetaModel and will be shown in the **Libraries
Browser**. Double-clicking the MetaModel in the **Library Browser** will display
the double pendulum MetaModel as shown below in
:numref:`tlm-double-pendulum-metamodel-textview`.

  :name: tlm-double-pendulum-metamodel-textview

  Double Pendulum MetaModel Text View.

Co-Simulating the MetaModel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways to start co-simulation:

-  Click **TLM Co-Simulation setup button** (|tlm-simulate|) from the toolbar (requires a MetaModel to be active in MetaModel Widget)

.. |tlm-simulate| image:: media/omedit-icons/tlm-simulate.*
  :alt: MetaModel simulate Icon
  :height: 14pt

-  Right click the MetaModel in the **Library Browser** and choose **TLM Co-Simulation setup** from the popup menu (see :numref:`tlm-library-browser-popup-menu`)

.. figure :: media/tlm-library-browser-popup-menu.png
  :name: tlm-library-browser-popup-menu

The TLM Co-Simulation setup appears as shown below in :numref:`tlm-cosimulation-setup`.

.. figure :: media/tlm-cosimulation-setup.png
  :name: tlm-cosimulation-setup

  TLM Co-simulation Setup.

Click **Simulate** from the Co-simulation setup to confirm the co-simulation.
:numref:`tlm-cosimulation-progress` will appears in which you will be able to see
the progress information of the running co-simulation.

.. figure :: media/tlm-cosimulation-progress.png
  :name: tlm-cosimulation-progress

  TLM Co-Simulation Progress.

The editor also provides the means of reading the log files generated by the simulation manager and monitor.
When the simulation ends, click **Open Manager Log File** or **Open Monitor Log File** from the co-simulation progress bar
to check the log files.

Plotting the Simulation Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the co-simulation of the MetaModel is completed successful, simulation results are collected and visualized
in the OMEdit plotting perspective as shown in :numref:`tlm-plotting-cosimulation-results`.
The **Variables Browser** display variables that can be plotted. Each variable has a checkbox, checking it will plot the variable.

MetaModeling in OMEdit
----------------------

Preparing External Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First step in co-simulation Modeling is to prepare the different external simulation
models with TLM interfaces. Each external model belongs to a specific simulation
tool, such as **MATLAB/Simulink***, **BEAST**, **MSC/ADAMS**, **Dymola** and **Wolfram SystemModeler**.

When the external models have all been prepared, the next step is to load external models
in OMEdit by selecting the **File > Load External Model(s)** from the menu.

OMEdit starts loading the external model and will be shown in the **Libraries Browser**
as shown below in :numref:`tlm-loaded-external-models-library-browser`.

.. figure :: media/tlm-loaded-external-models-library-browser.png

  External Models in OMEdit.

Creating a New MetaModel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new MetaModel,select **File > New MetaModel** from the menu.

Your new MetaModel will appear in the in the **Libraries Browser** once created.
To facilitate the process of textual metamodeling and to provide users with a
starting point, the **Text View** (see :numref:`tlm-new-metamodel-textview`)
includes the MetaModel XML elements and the default simulation parameters.

Saving the MetaModel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



Adding Submodels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to build the double pendulum by drag-and-drop of each simulation
model component (sub-model) from the **Libraries Browser** to the Diagram View.
To place a component in the Diagram View of the double pendulum model, drag each
external sub-model of the double pendulum (i.e. **Shaft1**, **Shaft2**, and
**BEAST bearing** sub-model) from the **Libraries Browser** to the **Diagram
View**.

Fetching Submodels Interface Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To retrieve list of TLM interface data for sub-models, do any of the following methods:

- Click **fetch interface points button** (|interface-data|) from the toolbar (requires a MetaModel to be active in ModelWidget)

.. |interface-data| image:: media/omedit-icons/interface-data.*
  :alt: MetaModel Interface Data Icon
  :height: 14pt

- Right click the MetaModel in the **Library Browser** and choose **Fetch Interface Data** from the popup menu
  (see :numref:`tlm-library-browser-popup-menu`).

:numref:`tlm-fetch-interface-progress` will appear in which you will be able to see the progress information
of fetching the interface data.

.. figure :: media/tlm-fetch-interface-progress.png
  :name: tlm-fetch-interface-progress

  Fetching Interface Data Progress.

Once the TLM interface data of the sub-models are retrieved, the interface points will appear
in the diagram view as shown below in :numref:`tlm-fetched-interface-points`.

  :name: tlm-fetched-interface-points

  Fetching Interface Data.

Connecting Submodels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the sub-models and interface points have all been placed in the Diagram
View, similar to :numref:`tlm-fetched-interface-points`, the next step is to
connect the sub-models. Sub-models are connected using the **Connection Line
Button** (|connect-mode|) from the toolbar.

.. |connect-mode| image:: media/omedit-icons/connect-mode.*
  :alt: Connection Line Icon
  :height: 14pt

To connect two sub-models, select the Connection Line Button and place the mouse cursor over an interface
and click the left mouse button, then drag the cursor to the other sub-model interface, and
click the left mouse button again. A connection dialog box as shown below in :numref:`tlm-submodels-connection-dialog` will
appear in which you will be able to specify the connection attributes.

.. figure :: media/tlm-submodels-connection-dialog.png

Continue to connect all sub-models until the MetaModel **Diagram View** looks like the one in :numref:`tlm-connecting-submodels-double-pendulum` below.

-  Double-click on the sub-model you want to change its parameter
-  Right click on the sub-model and choose **Attributes** from the popup menu

The parameter dialog of that sub-model appears as shown below in :numref:`tlm-change-submodel-parameters-dialog`
in which you will be able to specify the sub-models attributes.
