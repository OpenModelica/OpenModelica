The OSMC-PL is an Open Source license for OpenModelica with three modes/alternatives 
(OSMC-GPL, OSMC-Internal-EPL, OSMC-External-EPL) for use and redistribution, in source 
and/or binary/object-code form:
* Any party (member or non-member of OSMC) may only use and redistribute OpenModelica under OSMC-GPL conditions.
* Level 1 members of OSMC may also use and redistribute OpenModelica under OSMC-Internal-EPL conditions.
* Level 2 members of OSMC may also use and redistribute OpenModelica under OSMC-Internal-EPL or OSMC-External-EPL conditions.


Definitions of OSMC Public licence modes:
* OSMC-GPL = These OSMC Public license conditions together with Strict GPL3, i.e. GPL 
  version 3 with the additional conditions that an application program (i.e., not an 
  operating system) that integrates and calls parts of OpenModelica (also including 
  the case of executing parts of OpenModelica as another process), must be made freely 
  available and easily accessible as open source. 
  [Comment: note that the OSMC Public License, also its OSMC-GPL mode, is different from 
   and incompatible with GPL. Therefore it is not possible to include any GPL-licensed 
   contribution into OpenModelica.]
* OSMC-Internal-EPL = These OSMC Public license conditions together with Internally 
  restricted EPL, i.e., EPL version 1.0 with the Additional Condition that use and 
  redistribution by an OSMC member is only allowed within the OSMC member's own 
  organization (i.e., its own legal entity).
* OSMC-External-EPL = These OSMC Public license conditions together with Externally 
  restricted EPL, i.e., EPL version 1.0 with the Additional Condition that use and 
  redistribution by an OSMC member to parties external to the OSMC member’s own 
  organization (i.e., its own legal entity), is only allowed in binary/object-code 
  form, except the case of redistribution to other OSMC members to which source is 
  also allowed to be distributed. 
  [This has the consequence that an external party who wishes to use OpenModelica in 
   source form together with its own proprietary software in all cases must be a member of OSMC].

In all cases of usage and redistribution by recipients, the following conditions also apply:
a) Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, all definitions, and conditions. 
   It is sufficient if the OSMC-PL Header is present in each source file, if the full OSMC-PL is available 
   in a prominent and easily located place in the redistribution.
b) Redistributions in binary/object-code form must reproduce the above copyright notice, all definitions, 
   and conditions. It is sufficient if the OSMC-PL Header and the location in the redistribution of the 
   full OSMC-PL is present in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the redistribution, 
   if the full OSMC-PL is available in a prominent and easily located place in the redistribution.
c) A recipient must clearly indicate its chosen usage mode of OSMC-PL, in accompanying documentation and 
   in a text file OSMC-USAGE-MODE.txt, provided with the distribution.
d) Contributor(s) making a Contribution to OpenModelica thereby also makes a Transfer of Contribution Copyright. 
   In return, upon the effective date of the transfer, OSMC grants the Contributor(s) a Contribution License of 
   the Contribution. OSMC has the right to accept or refuse Contributions.

Definitions:
"Subsidiary license conditions" means: 
 The additional license conditions depending on the by the recipient chosen mode of OSMC-PL, 
 defined by GPL version 3.0 for OSMC-GPL, and by EPL for OSMC-Internal-EPL and OSMC-External-EPL.

"OSMC-PL" means: 
 Open Source Modelica Consortium Public License version 1.0, i.e., the license defined here 
 (the text between "--- Start of Definition of OSMC Public License ---" 
 and "--- End of Definition of OSMC Public License ---"), or later versions thereof.

"OSMC-PL Header" means: 
 Open Source Modelica Consortium Public License Header version 1.0, i.e., the text between 
 "--- Start of Definition of OSMC Public License ---" and 
 "--- End of OSMC Public License Header ---", or later versions thereof.

"Contribution" means: 
  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial 
     code and documentation distributed under OSMC-PL, and
  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
       i) changes to OpenModelica, and
       ii) additions to OpenModelica;
     where such changes and/or additions to OpenModelica originate from and are distributed by 
     that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added 
     to OpenModelica by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 

For Contributors licencing OpenModelica under OSMC-Internal-EPL or OSMC-External-EPL conditions, 
the following conditions also hold:  
  Contributions do not include additions to the distributed Program which: 
   (i)   are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction 
         with OpenModelica under their own license agreement, 
   (ii)  are separate modules which are not derivative works of OpenModelica, and
   (iii) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with OpenModelica 
         under their own license agreement where these separate modules are merged with 
         (weaved together with) modules of OpenModelica to form new modules that are 
         distributed as object code or source code under their own license agreement, 
         as allowed under the Additional Condition of internal distribution according 
         to OSMC-Internal-EPL and/or Additional Condition for external distribution 
         according to OSMC-External-EPL.

"Transfer of Contribution Copyright" means that 
 the Contributors of a Contribution transfer the ownership and the copyright of the Contribution 
 to Linköpings universitet, the OpenModelica Copyright owner, for inclusion in OpenModelica. 
 The transfer takes place upon the effective date when the Contribution is made available on 
 the OSMC web site under OSMC-PL, by such Contributors themselves or anyone acting on such 
 Contributors' behalf. The transfer is free of charge. If the Contributors or OSMC so wish, 
 an optional Copyright transfer agreement can be signed between OSMC and the Contributors, 
 as specified in an Appendix of the OSMC Bylaws.

"Contribution License" means a license from OSMC to the Contributors of the Contribution, effective 
 on the date of the Transfer of Contribution Copyright, where OSMC grants the Contributors a non-exclusive, 
 world-wide, transferable, free of charge, perpetual license, including sublicensing rights, to use, 
 have used, modify, have modified, reproduce and or have reproduced the contributed material, for 
 business and other purposes, including but not limited to evaluation, development, testing, 
 integration and merging with other software and distribution. The warranty and liability disclaimers 
 of OSMC-PL applies to this license.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes (part of) OpenModelica.

"The Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with OSMC-PL. 

"OpenModelica" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with OSMC-PL. 

"Recipient" means anyone who receives OpenModelica under OSMC-PL, including all Contributors. 

NO WARRANTY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE BY RECIPIENT SELECTED SUBSIDIARY LICENSE CONDITIONS 
OF OSMC-PL, OPENMODELICA IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS 
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing 
OPENMODELICA and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under OSMC-PL, 
including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable 
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE BY RECIPIENT SELECTED SUBSIDIARY LICENSE CONDITIONS OF OSMC-PL, 
NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED 
AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE 
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF OPENMODELICA OR THE EXERCISE OF 
ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

A Contributor licensing OpenModelica under OSMC-Internal-EPL or OSMC-External-EPL 
may choose to distribute (parts of) OpenModelica in object code form under its own 
license agreement, provided that: 
  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of OSMC-PL; or for the case of redistribution of OpenModelica 
     together with proprietary code it is a dual license where the OpenModelica parts are distributed under 
     OSMC-PL compatible conditions and the proprietary code is distributed under proprietary license conditions; and
  b) its license agreement:
      i)   effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, 
           including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions 
           of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 
      ii)  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, 
           special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; 
      iii) states that any provisions which differ from OSMC-PL are offered by that Contributor alone and not by 
           any other party; and
      iv)  states from where the source code for OpenModelica is available, and informs licensees how to obtain 
           it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

When OPENMODELICA is made available in source code form: 
  a) it must be made available under OSMC-PL; and 
  b) a copy of OSMC-PL must be included with each copy of OPENMODELICA. 
  c) a copy of the subsidiary license associated with the selected mode of 
     OSMC-PL must be included with each copy of OPENMODELICA. 

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within OPENMODELICA. 
If there is a conflict between OSMC-PL and the subsidiary license conditions, OSMC-PL have priority.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of Sweden. The place of jurisdiction for all disagreements 
related to this Agreement, is Linköping, Sweden.
