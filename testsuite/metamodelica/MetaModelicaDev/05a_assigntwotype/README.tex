{\bf Assignment}

In this exercise you will:
\begin{itemize}
\item add a new String type to the current Exp node which can hold only integers as strings 
\item add cases to evaluate expressions and assignments of type "2" + 1 + "1" + 1.0 in the eval function
\item search for \code{// your code here} within \code{AssignTwoType.mo}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Optional assignment}
Change the code to allow the use of identifiers before actual declaration.
For example:
\begin{verbatim}
	a := b + 1
	b := 3
	;
	a+b
\end{verbatim}
Should return 7 instead of 4 as it returns now.

NOTE: the parser/lexer are ready, but you have to implement the types
before they start parsing \code{STRING} properly.

\code{SOLUTION.txt} presents the solution to the assignment.

To run the calculator type \code{run} when building the project (or \code{make run} from a terminal).

If you need to edit the input of the calculator edit the file called \code{program.txt}.
