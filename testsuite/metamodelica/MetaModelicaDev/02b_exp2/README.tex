In this exercise you will explore a different way to model the Exp1 language
using different Exp trees.
Explore the \code{Exp2.mo} file and compare it with \code{Exp1.mo} file.

{\bf Homework}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement the assignments from 02a within 02b.
\item Note that you will have to add the new operators to the lexer and parser.
\end{itemize}

To run the calculator type \code{run} when building the project (or \code{make run} from a terminal).

If you need to edit the input of the calculator edit the file called \code{program.txt}.
