In this exercise you transform expressions by symbolic differentiation.

{\bf Assignment}

\begin{itemize}
\item Add rules to derive \code{'-'}, \code{'*'}, sine, cosine and power expressions
\item Add rules to simplify \code{'-'}, sine, cosine and power expressions
\item search for \code{// your code here} within \code{SymbolicDerivative.mo}
\end{itemize}

\code{SOLUTION.txt} presents the solution to the assignment.

To run the calculator type \code{run} when building the project (or \code{make run} from a terminal).

If you need to edit the input of the calculator edit the file called \code{program.txt}.
