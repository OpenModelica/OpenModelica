1. Install OpenModelica 1.5.1 or later

2. Unpack Eclipse+MDT anywhere you want (e.g. to C:\ -- C:\eclipse)
   DO NOT START ECLIPSE YET.

3. Unpack OMDev.zip to c:

   After you unpack you will have a c:\OMDev directory
   with directories like tools, bin, lib, etc in it.

   Add an environment variable OMDEV=C:/OMDev
   Right click on My Computer->Properties->Advanced Tab
   ->Environment Variables->New
   OMDev.zip MUST BE INSTALLED INTO c:\OMDev

4. Unpack MetaModelica Exercises to /path/to/MetaModelica  e.g. (C:\MetaModelica)

   Read into MetaModelica/documentation/MetaModelica Expercises.ppt
   Start Eclipse and point the workspace to /path/to/MetaModelica

4b. Edit the file eclipse.bat to reflect where you put Eclipse
    (e.g. c:\eclipse\eclipse.exe   for the run command)

5. Enjoy. (Start Eclipse e.g. by running the eclipse.bat file)

  of how to model different languages 
  using MetaModelica.
