In this exercise you will add new constructs to the Exp1 language and deal with
their evaluation.

{\bf Assignment}

Add the following constructs to the language:
\begin{itemize}
\item a power operator
\item a factorial operator
\item search for \code{// your code here} within \code{Exp1.mo}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Note 1}

The parser/lexer are ready, but give parser errors for the new operators
until they are added in \code{Exp1.mo} (add them last in the uniontype to avoid weird
errors).

{\bf Note 2}

The parser/lexer uses a prefix factorial operator (!5, not 5!).

\code{SOLUTION.txt} presents the solution to the assignment.

To run the calculator type \code{run} when building the project (or \code{make run} from a terminal).

If you need to edit the input of the calculator edit the file called \code{program.txt}.
