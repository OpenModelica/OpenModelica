Parameter Sensitivities with OpenModelica
=========================================

This section describes the use of OpenModelica to compute parameter
sensitivities using forward sensitivity analysis together with the
Sundials/IDA solver.

Single Parameter sensitivities with IDA/Sundials
------------------------------------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter sensitivity analysis aims at analyzing the behavior of the
corresponding model states w.r.t. model parameters.

Formally, consider a Modelica model as a DAE system:

.. math::
    F(x, \dot x, y, p, t) = 0 \; x(t_0) = x_0(p)

where
:math:`x(t) \in \mathbf{R}^n` represent state variables,
:math:`\dot x(t) \in \mathbf{R}^n` represent state derivatives,
:math:`y(t) \in \mathbf{R}^k` represent algebraic variables,
:math:`p \in \mathbf{R}^m` model parameters.

For parameter sensitivity analysis the derivatives

.. math::
    \frac{\partial x}{ \partial p}

are required which quantify, according to their mathematical definition,
the impact of parameters :math:`p` on states :math:`x`.
In the Sundials/IDA implementation the derivatives are used to evolve the
solution over the time by:

.. math::
    \dot s_i = \frac{\partial x}{ \partial p_i}


An Example
~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates the usage of the sensitivities analysis in
OpenModelica on an example. This module is enabled by the following
OpenModelica compiler flag:

.. omc-mos ::

  setCommandLineOptions("--calculateSensitivities")

.. omc-loadstring ::
  :caption: LotkaVolterra.mo
  :name: LotkaVolterra.mo

  model LotkaVolterra
    Real x(start=5, fixed=true),y(start=3, fixed=true);
    parameter Real mu1=5,mu2=2;
    parameter Real lambda1=3,lambda2=1;
  equation
    0 = x*(mu1-lambda1*y) - der(x);
    0 = -y* (mu2 -lambda2*x) - der(y);
  end LotkaVolterra;

Also for the simulation it is needed to set ``IDA`` as solver integration
method and add a further simulation flag ``-idaSensitivity`` to calculate
the parameter sensitivities during the normal simulation.

.. omc-mos ::

  simulate(LotkaVolterra, method="ida", simflags="-idaSensitivity")

Now all calculated sensitivities are stored into the results mat file under
the $Sensitivities block, where all currently every
**top-level** parameter of the Real type is used to calculate the
sensitivities w.r.t. **every state**.

.. omc-gnuplot :: LotkaVolterraSensitivities

Single and Multi-parameter sensitivities with OMSens
----------------------------------------------------

OpenModelica sensitivity analysis and optimization module.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core files of OMSens are provided as part of the OpenModelica installation.
However, you still need to install python and build OMSens with that python before using it.
Follow the installation process described on the `OMSens github page <https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMSens>`_.

Usage
~~~~~

OMSens offers 3 flavors for parameter sensitivity analysis.

-  Individual Sensitivity Analysis
  -  Used to analyze how a parameter affects a variable when perturbed on its own
-  Multi-parameter Sweep
  -  Exploratory experimentation that sweeps the space of a set of parameters
-  Vectorial Sensitivity Analysis
  -  Used to find the combination of parameters that maximizes/minimizes a state variable

We choose the Lotka-Volterra model that consists of a second-order nonlinear set of ordinary
differential equations. The system models the relationship between the populations of predators
and preys in a closed ecosystem.

.. code-block :: modelica

  model LotkaVolterra "This is the typical equation-oriented model"
    parameter Real alpha=0.1 "Reproduction rate of prey";
    parameter Real beta=0.02 "Mortality rate of predator per prey";
    parameter Real gamma=0.4 "Mortality rate of predator";
    parameter Real delta=0.02 "Reproduction rate of predator per prey";
    parameter Real prey_pop_init=10 "Initial prey population";
    parameter Real pred_pop_init=10 "Initial predator population";
    Real prey_pop(start=prey_pop_init) "Prey population";
    Real pred_pop(start=pred_pop_init) "Predator population";
  initial equation
    prey_pop = prey_pop_init;
    pred_pop = pred_pop_init;
  equation
    der(prey_pop) = prey_pop*(alpha-beta*pred_pop);
    der(pred_pop) = pred_pop*(delta*prey_pop-gamma);
  end LotkaVolterra;

Let’s say we need to investigate the influence of model parameters on the predator population
at 40 units of time. We assume a +/-5% uncertainty on model parameters.

We can use OMSens to study the sensitivity model to each parameter, one at a time.

Open the Lotka-Volterra model using OMEdit.

.. _individual-sensitivity-analysis :

Individual Sensitivity Analysis
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

-  Select *Sensitivity Optimization > Run Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization* from the menu.
   A window like the one below should appear.

.. figure :: media/omsens-window.png

  OMSens window.

-  Choose **Individual Parameter Based Sensitivity Analysis** and set up the simulation settings.

.. figure :: media/omsens-individual-analysis.png

  Run individual sensitivity analysis.

-  Select variables.

.. figure :: media/omsens-individual-analysis-variables.png

  Individual sensitivity analysis variables.

-  Select parameters.

.. figure :: media/omsens-individual-analysis-parameters.png

  Individual sensitivity analysis parameters.

-  Choose the perturbation percentage and direction. Run the analysis.

.. figure :: media/omsens-individual-analysis-perturbation.png

  Individual sensitivity analysis perturbation.

-  After the analysis a dialog with results is shown.
   Open the heatmap corresponding to the relative sensitivity index.

.. figure :: media/omsens-individual-analysis-results.png

  Individual sensitivity analysis results.

-  The heatmap shows the effect of each parameter on each variable in the form of
   (parameter,variable) cells. As we can see, pred_pop was affected by the perturbation on every
   parameter but prey_pop presents a negligible sensitivity to delta (P.3).
   Recall that this heatmap shows the effect on the variables at time 40
   for each perturbation imposed at time 0.

.. figure :: media/omsens-individual-analysis-heatmap.png

  Individual sensitivity analysis heatmap.

Multi-parameter Sweep
"""""""""""""""""""""

Now we would like to see what happens to pred_pop when the top 3 most influencing parameters are
perturbed at the same time. Repeat the first three steps from :ref:`individual-sensitivity-analysis`
but this time select **Multi-parameter Sweep**.

-  Choose to sweep alpha, gamma and pred_pop_init in a range of ±5% from its default value
   and with 3 iterations (#iter) distributed equidistantly within that range. Run the sweep analysis.

.. figure :: media/omsens-multi-sweep-parameters.png

  Multi-parameter sweep parameters.

-  The backend is invoked and when it completes the analysis the following results dialog is
   shown. Open the plot for pred_pop.

.. figure :: media/omsens-multi-sweep-results.png

  Multi-parameter sweep results.

-  At time 40 the parameters perturbations with a higher predator population are all blue,
   but it’s not clear which one. We need something more precise.

.. figure :: media/omsens-multi-sweep-plot.png

  Multi-parameter sweep plot.

   These results can be very informative but clearly the exhaustive exploration approach doesn't
   scale for more parameters (#p) and more perturbation values (#v) (#v^#p simulations required).

Vectorial Sensitivity Analysis
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Using the Vectorial optimization-based analysis (see below) we can request OMSens to find a
combination of parameters that perturbs the most (i.e. minimize or maximize) the value of the
target variable at a desired simulation time.

For **Vectorial Sensitivity Analysis** repeat the first two steps from
:ref:`individual-sensitivity-analysis` but choose **Vectorial Parameter Based Sensitivity Analysis**.

-  Choose only alpha, delta and pred_pop_init to perturb.

.. figure :: media/omsens-vectorial-analysis-parameters.png

  Vectorial sensitivity analysis parameters.

-  Setup the optimization settings and run the analysis.

.. figure :: media/omsens-vectorial-analysis-optimization.png

  Vectorial sensitivity analysis optimization.

-  The **Parameters** tab in the results window shows the values found by the optimization
   routine that maximize pred_pop at t=40 s.

.. figure :: media/omsens-vectorial-analysis-results.png

  Vectorial sensitivity analysis parameters result.

-  The **State Variable** tab shows the comparison between the values of the variable in the
   standard run vs the perturbed run at simulation time 40s.

.. figure :: media/omsens-vectorial-analysis-state-variables.png

  Vectorial sensitivity analysis state variables.

-  If we simulate using the optimum values and compare it to the standard (unperturbed) run,
   we see that it **delays the bell** described by the variable.

.. figure :: media/omsens-vectorial-analysis-plot.png

  Vectorial sensitivity analysis plot.

-  So far, we have only perturbed the top 3 parameters detected by the **Individual Sensitivity**
   method. Maybe we can find a greater effect on the variable if we perturb all 6 parameters.
   Running a Sweep is not an option as perturbing 6 parameters with 3 iterations each results in
   3⁶=729 simulations. We run another Vectorial Sensitivity Analysis instead but now choose to
   perturb all 6 parameters.

.. figure :: media/omsens-vectorial-analysis-parameters-all.png

  Vectorial sensitivity analysis parameters.

-  The **parameters tab** shows that the optimum value is found by perturbing all of the
   parameters to their boundaries.

.. figure :: media/omsens-vectorial-analysis-results-all.png

  Vectorial sensitivity analysis parameters result.

-  The **State Variable** tab shows that pred_pop can be increased by 98% when perturbing the
   6 parameters as opposed to 68% when perturbing the top 3 influencing parameters.

.. figure :: media/omsens-vectorial-analysis-state-variables.png

  Vectorial sensitivity analysis state variables.

-  The plot shows again that the parameters found delay the bell-shaped curve, but with a
   stronger impact than before.
