OMEdit – OpenModelica Connection Editor
=======================================

OMEdit – OpenModelica Connection Editor is the new Graphical User
Interface for graphical model editing in OpenModelica. It is implemented
in C++ using the Qt graphical user interface library and supports
the Modelica Standard Library that is included in the latest
OpenModelica installation. This chapter gives a brief introduction to
OMEdit and also demonstrates how to create a DCMotor model using the
editor.

OMEdit provides several user friendly features for creating, browsing,
editing, and simulating models:

-  *Modeling* – Easy model creation for Modelica models.

-  *Pre-defined models* – Browsing the Modelica Standard library to
   access the provided models.

-  *User defined models* – Users can create their own models for
   immediate usage and later reuse.

-  *Component interfaces* – Smart connection editing for drawing and
   editing connections between model interfaces.

-  *Simulation* – Subsystem for running simulations and specifying
   simulation parameters start and stop time, etc.

-  *Plotting* – Interface to plot variables from simulated models.

Starting OMEdit
---------------

A splash screen similar to the one shown in :numref:`omedit-splash` will
appear indicating that it is starting OMEdit.
The executable is found in different places depending on the platform
(see below).

  :name: omedit-mainwindow-browsers

  OMEdit MainWindow and Browsers.

The default location of the browsers are shown in :numref:`omedit-mainwindow-browsers`.
All browsers except for Message Browser can be docked into left or right
column. The Messages Browser can be docked into top or bottom
areas. If you want OMEdit to remember the new docked position of the
browsers then you must enable Preserve User's GUI Customizations option,
see section :ref:`omedit-options-general`.

.. _omedit-filter-classes :

Filter Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To filter a class click Edit > Filter Classes or press keyboard
shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F. The loaded Modelica classes can be filtered by
typing any part of the class name.

Libraries Browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the Libraries Browser click View > Windows > Libraries Browser.
Shows the list of loaded Modelica classes. Each item of the Libraries
Browser has right click menu for easy manipulation and usage of the
class. The classes are shown in a tree structure with name and icon. The
protected classes are not shown by default. If you want to see the
protected classes then you must enable the Show Protected Classes
option, see section :ref:`omedit-options-general`.

.. figure :: media/omedit-libraries-browser.png

  Libraries Browser.

Documentation Browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays the HTML documentation of Modelica classes. It contains the
navigation buttons for moving forward and backward. It also contains
a WYSIWYG editor which allows writing class documentation in HTML format.

.. _omedit-variables-browser :

Variables Browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The class variables are structured in the form of the tree and are
displayed in the Variables Browser. Each variable has a checkbox.
Ticking the checkbox will plot the variable values. There is a find box
on the top for filtering the variable in the tree. The filtering can be
done using Regular Expression, Wildcard and Fixed String. The complete
Variables Browser can be collapsed and expanded using the Collapse All
and Expand All buttons.

The browser allows manipulation of changeable parameters for
:ref:`omedit-resimulation`. It also displays the unit and
description of the variable.

The browser also contains the slider and animation buttons. These controls
are used for variable graphics and schematic animation of models i.e.,
DynamicSelect annotation. They are also used for debugging of state machines.
Open the :ref:`omedit-diagram-window` for animation. It is only possible
to animate one model at a time. This is achieved by marking the result
file active in the Variables Browser. The animation only read the values
from the active result file. It is possible to simulate several models.
In that case, the user will see a list of result files in the Variables Browser.
The user can switch between different result files by right clicking
on the result file and selecting **Set Active** in the context menu.

Simulating a Model
------------------

The simulation options for each model are stored inside the OMEdit data structure.
They have the following sequence,

-  Each model has its own simulation options.

-  If the model is opened for the first time then the simulation options
   are set to default.

-  ``experiment`` and ``__OpenModelica_simulationFlags`` annotations are
   applied if the model contains them.

-  After that all the changes done via Simulation Setup window are
   preserved for the whole session. If you want to use the same settings in
   the future sessions then you should store them inside ``experiment`` and
   ``__OpenModelica_simulationFlags``.

The OMEdit Simulation Setup can be launched by,

-  Selecting Simulation > Simulation Setup from the menu. (requires a
   model to be active in ModelWidget)

-  Clicking on the Simulation Setup toolbar button. (requires a model to

3D Visualization
----------------

.. highlight:: modelica

Since OpenModelica 1.11 , OMEdit has built-in 3D visualization,
which replaces third-party libraries (such as `Modelica3D
<https://github.com/OpenModelica/Modelica3D>`_) for 3D visualization.

Running a Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 3d visualization is based on OpenSceneGraph. In order to run the
visualization simply right click the class in Libraries Browser an
choose “\ **Simulate with Animation**\ ” as shown in :numref:`omedit-simulate-animation`.

.. figure :: media/omedit_simulate_animation.png
  :name: omedit-simulate-animation

  OMEdit Simulate with Animation.

One can also run the visualization via Simulation > Simulate with Animation from the menu.

When simulating a model in animation mode, the flag *+d=visxml* is set.
Hence, the compiler will generate a scene description file *_visual.xml* which stores all information on the multibody shapes.
This scene description references all variables which are needed for the animation of the multibody system.
When simulating with *+d=visxml*, the compiler will always generate results for these variables.

Viewing a Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the successful simulation of the model, the visualization window will
show up automatically as shown in :numref:`omedit-visualization`.

.. figure :: media/omedit_visualization.png
  :name: omedit-visualization

  OMEdit 3D Visualization.

The animation starts with pushing the *play* button. The animation is played until stopTime or until the *pause* button is pushed.
By pushing the *previous* button, the animation jumps to the initial point of time.
Points of time can be selected by moving the *time slider* or by inserting a simulation time in the *Time-box*.
The speed factor of animation in relation to realtime can be set in the *Speed-dialog*.
Other animations can be openend by using the *open file* button and selecting a result file with a corresping scene description file.

The 3D camera view can be manipulated as follows:

========================  ============================== ========================
  Operation                Key                            Mouse Action
========================  ============================== ========================
Move Closer/Further        none                           Wheel
Move Closer/Further        Right Mouse Hold               Up/Down
Move Up/Down/Left/Right    Middle Mouse Hold              Move Mouse
Move Up/Down/Left/Right    Left and Right Mouse Hold      Move Mouse
Rotate                     Left Mouse Hold                Move Mouse
Shape context menu         Right Mouse + Shift
========================  ============================== ========================

Predefined views (Isometric, Side, Front, Top) can be selected and the scene can be tilted by 90° either clock or anticlockwise with the rotation buttons.

Additional Visualization Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shapes that are displayed in the viewer can be selected with shift + right click.
If a shape is selected, a context menu pops up that offers additional visualization features

.. figure :: media/pick_shape.png
  :name: A context menu to set additional visualization features for the selected shape.

The following features can be selected:

========================  ================================================================================================
  Menu                      Description

Animation of Realtime FMUs
--------------------------

Instead of a result file, OMEdit can load Functional Mock-up Units to retrieve the data for the animation of multibody systems.
Just like opening a mat-file from the animation-plotting view, one can open an FMU-file.
Necessarily, the FMU has to be generated with the *+d=visxml* flag activated, so that a scene description file is generated in the same directory as the FMU.
Currently, only FMU 1.0 and FMU 2.0 model exchange are supported.
When choosing an FMU, the simulation settings window pops up to choose solver and step size.
Afterwards, the model initializes and can be simulated by pressing the play button.

Interactive Realtime Animation of FMUs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FMUs can be simulated with realtime user interaction.
A possible solution is to equip the model with an interaction model from the Modelica_DeviceDrivers library (https://github.com/modelica/Modelica_DeviceDrivers).
The realtime synchronization is done by OMEdit so no additional time synchronization model is necessary.

Interactive Simulation
----------------------

.. warning ::
  Interactive simulation is an experimental feature.

Interactive simulation is enabled by selecting interactive
simulation in the :ref:`General <omedit-general-tab>` tab of the simulation setup.

There are two main modes of execution: asynchronous and synchronous
(simulate with steps). The difference is that in synchronous (step mode),
OMEdit sends a command to the simulation for each step that the simulation
should take. The asynchronous mode simply tells the simulation to run and
samples variables values in real-time; if the simulation runs very fast,
fewer values will be sampled.

When running in asynchronous mode, it is possible to simulate the model
in real-time (with a scaling factor just like simulation flag
:ref:`-rt <simflag-rt>`, but with the ability to change the scaling
factor during the interactive simulation). In the synchronous mode, the
speed of the simulation does not directly correspond to real-time.

How to Create User Defined Shapes – Icons
-----------------------------------------

Users can create shapes of their own by using the shape creation tools
available in OMEdit.

-  *Line Tool* – Draws a line. A line is created with a minimum of two
   points. In order to create a line, the user first selects the
   line tool from the toolbar and then click on the Icon/Diagram
   View; this will start creating a line. If a user clicks again on
   the Icon/Diagram View a new line point is created. In order to
   finish the line creation, user has to double click on the
   Icon/Diagram View.

-  *Polygon Tool* – Draws a polygon. A polygon is created in a similar
   fashion as a line is created. The only difference between a line
   and a polygon is that, if a polygon contains two points it will
   look like a line and if a polygon contains more than two points
   it will become a closed polygon shape.

-  *Rectangle Tool* – Draws a rectangle. The rectangle only contains two
   points where first point indicates the starting point and the
   second point indicates the ending the point. In order to create
   rectangle, the user has to select the rectangle tool from the
   toolbar and then click on the Icon/Diagram View, this click will
   become the first point of rectangle. In order to finish the
   rectangle creation, the user has to click again on the
   Icon/Diagram View where he/she wants to finish the rectangle. The
   second click will become the second point of rectangle.

-  *Ellipse Tool* – Draws an ellipse. The ellipse is created in a
   similar way as a rectangle is created.

-  *Text Tool* – Draws a text label.

-  *Bitmap Tool* – Draws a bitmap container.

The shape tools are located in the toolbar. See :numref:`omedit-user-defined-shapes`.

.. figure :: media/omedit-user-defined-shapes.png
  :name: omedit-user-defined-shapes

  User defined shapes.

The user can select any of the shape tools and start drawing on the
Icon/Diagram View. The shapes created on the Diagram View of Model
Widget are part of the diagram and the shapes created on the Icon View
will become the icon representation of the model.

For example, if a user creates a model with name testModel and add a
rectangle using the rectangle tool and a polygon using the polygon tool,
in the Icon View of the model. The model’s Modelica Text will appear as
follows:

.. code-block :: modelica

  model testModel
    annotation(Icon(graphics = {Rectangle(rotation = 0, lineColor = {0,0,255}, fillColor = {0,0,255}, pattern = LinePattern.Solid, fillPattern = FillPattern.None, lineThickness = 0.25, extent = {{ -64.5,88},{63, -22.5}}),Polygon(points = {{ -47.5, -29.5},{52.5, -29.5},{4.5, -86},{ -47.5, -29.5}}, rotation = 0, lineColor = {0,0,255}, fillColor = {0,0,255}, pattern = LinePattern.Solid, fillPattern = FillPattern.None, lineThickness = 0.25)}));
  end testModel;

In the above code snippet of testModel, the rectangle and a polygon are
added to the icon annotation of the model. Similarly, any user defined
shape drawn on a Diagram View of the model will be added to the diagram
annotation of the model.

Global head section in documentation
------------------------------------

If you want to use same styles or same JavaScript for the classes contained inside a package then
you can define ``__OpenModelica_infoHeader`` annotation inside the ``Documentation`` annotation of a package.
For example,

.. code-block :: modelica

  package P
    model M
      annotation(Documentation(info="<html>
        <a href=\"javascript:HelloWorld()\">Click here</a>
      </html>"));
    end M;
   annotation(Documentation(__OpenModelica_infoHeader="
       <script type=\"text/javascript\">
         function HelloWorld() {
           alert(\"Hello World!\");
         }
       </script>"));
  end P;

In the above example model ``M`` does not need to define the javascript function ``HelloWorld``.
It is only defined once at the package level using the ``__OpenModelica_infoHeader`` and then all classes
contained in the package can use it.

In addition styles and JavaScript can be added from file locations using Modelica URIs.
Example:

.. code-block :: modelica

  package P
    model M
      annotation(Documentation(info="<html>
        <a href=\"javascript:HelloWorld()\">Click here</a>
      </html>"));
    end M;
   annotation(Documentation(__OpenModelica_infoHeader="
       <script type=\"text/javascript\">
          src=\"modelica://P/Resources/hello.js\">
         }
       </script>"));
  end P;

Where the file ``Resources/hello.js`` then contains:

.. code-block :: javascript

  function HelloWorld() {
    alert("Hello World!");
  }

__OpenModelica_commandLineOptions Annotation
--------------------------------------------

OpenModelica specific annotation to define the command line options needed to simulate the model.
For example if you always want to simulate the model with a specific matching algorithm and index
reduction method instead of the default ones then you can write the following code,

.. code-block :: modelica

  model Test
    annotation(__OpenModelica_commandLineOptions = "--matchingAlgorithm=BFSB --indexReductionMethod=dynamicStateSelection");
  end Test;

The annotation is a space separated list of options where each option is either just a command line
flag or a flag with a value.

In OMEdit open the Simulation Setup and set the Translation Flags then
in the bottom check `Save translation flags inside model i.e., __OpenModelica_commandLineOptions annotation` and click on OK.

If you want to ignore this annotation then use `setCommandLineOptions("--ignoreCommandLineOptionsAnnotation=true")`.
In OMEdit *Tools > Options > Simulation* check `Ignore __OpenModelica_commandLineOptions annotation`.

__OpenModelica_simulationFlags Annotation
-----------------------------------------

OpenModelica specific annotation to define the simulation options needed to simulate the model.
For example if you always want to simulate the model with a specific solver instead of the
default DASSL and would also like to see the cpu time then you can write the following code,

.. code-block :: modelica

  model Test
    annotation(__OpenModelica_simulationFlags(s = "heun", cpu = "()"));
  end Test;

The annotation is a comma separated list of options where each option is a simulation flag
with a value. For flags that doesn't have any value use `()` (See the above code example).

In OMEdit open the Simulation Setup and set the Simulation Flags then
in the bottom check `Save simulation flags inside model i.e., __OpenModelica_simulationFlags annotation` and click on OK.

If you want to ignore this annotation then use `setCommandLineOptions("--ignoreSimulationFlagsAnnotation=true")`.
In OMEdit *Tools > Options > Simulation* check `Ignore __OpenModelica_simulationFlags annotation`.

Debugger
--------

For debugging capability, see :ref:`debugging`.

.. _editingMSL :

Editing Modelica Standard Library
---------------------------------

By default OMEdit loads the Modelica Standard Library (MSL) as a system library. System libraries are read-only.
If you want to edit MSL you need to load it as user library instead of system library. We don't recommend editing
MSL but if you really need to and understand the consequences then follow these steps,

-  Go to *Tools > Options > Libraries*.
-  Remove Modelica & ModelicaReference from list of system libraries.
-  Uncheck *force loading of Modelica Standard Library*.
-  Add *$OPENMODELICAHOME/lib/omlibrary/Modelica X.X/package.mo* under user libraries.
-  Restart OMEdit.

State Machines
--------------

Creating a New Modelica State Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the same steps as defined in :ref:`creating-new-class`.
Additionally make sure you check the *State* checkbox.

.. figure :: media/new-state.png
  :name: omedit-new-state

  Creating a new Modelica state.

Making Transitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to make a transition from one state to another the user first needs
to enable the transition mode (|transition-mode|) from the toolbar.

Move the mouse over the state. The mouse cursor will change from arrow cursor to cross cursor.
To start the transition press left button and move while keeping the button pressed. Now release the left button.
Move towards the end state and click when cursor changes to cross cursor.

A *Create Transition* dialog box will appear which allows you to set the transition attributes.
Cancelling the dialog will cancel the transition.

Double click the transition or right click and choose *Edit Transition* to modify the transition attributes.

State Machines Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for Modelica state machines was added in the Modelica Language Specification
v3.3. A subtle problem can occur if Modelica v3.2 libraries are loaded, e.g., the
Modelica Standard Library v3.2.2, because
in this case OMC automatically switches into Modelica v3.2 compatibility mode.
Trying to simulate a state machine in Modelica v3.2 compatibility mode results
in an error. It is possible to use the OMC flag *--std=latest* in order to ensure
(at least) Modelica v3.3 support. In OMEdit this can be achieved by
setting that flag in the *Tools > Options > Simulation* dialog.

.. figure :: media/omedit-state-machine-simulation-settings.png
  :name: omedit-state-machine-simulation-settings

  Ensure (at least) Modelica v3.3 support.

State Machines Debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modelica state machines debugger is implemented as a visualization,
which allows the user to run the state machines simulation as an animation.

.. figure :: media/omedit-state-machine-debugger.png
  :name: omedit-state-machine-debugger

  State machine debugger in OMEdit.

A special Diagram Window is developed to visualize the active and inactive states.
The active and inactive value of the states are stored in the OpenModelica simulation result file.
After the successful simulation, of the state machine model, OMEdit reads the start,
stop time values, and initializes the visualization controls accordingly.

The controls allows the easy manipulation of the visualization,

* Rewind – resets the visualization to start.
* Play – starts the visualization.
* Pause – pauses the visualization.
* Time – allows the user to jump at any specific time.
* Speed – speed of the visualization.
* Slider – controls the time.

The visualization is based on the simulation result file.
All three formats of the simulation result file are supported i.e., mat, csv and plt
where mat is a matlab file format, csv is a comma separated file and plt is an ordered text file.

It is only possible to debug one state machine at a time.
This is achieved by marking the result file active in the Variables Browser.
The visualization only read the values from the active result file.
It is possible to simulate several state machine models.
In that case, the user will see a list of result files in the Variables Browser.
The user can switch between different result files by right clicking on the result file and selecting *Set Active* in the context menu.

Using OMEdit as Text Editor
---------------------------
OMEdit can be be used as a Text editor. Currently support for editing MetaModelica,Modelica and C/C++
are available with syntax highlighting and autocompletion of keywords and types. Additionaly the Modelica
and MetaModelica files are provided with autocompletion of code-snippets along with keywords and types.
The users can load the directory from file menu *File > Open Directory*. which opens the Directory structure
in the Libraries-browser.

After the directory is opened in the Libraries-browser, the users can expand the directory structure and click the file which
opens in the texteditor.

Advanced Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support to search in OMEdit texteditor is available. The search browser can be enabled by selecting
View > Windows > Search browser or through shortcut keys (ctrl+h).

After the search is completed the results are presented to the users in a separate window, The search results contains
the following

1) The name of the files where the searched word is matched
2) The line number and text of the matched word.

The users can click the line number or the matched text and it will automatically open the file in the texteditor and
move the cursor to matched line number of the text.

Temporary Directory, Working Directory and Log Files
----------------------------------------------------

On Unix/Linux systems temporary directory is the path in the `TMPDIR` environment variable
or `/tmp` if `TMPDIR` is not defined appended with directory paths `OpenModelica<USERNAME>/OMEdit`
so the complete path is usually `/tmp/OpenModelica<USERNAME>/OMEdit`.

On Windows its the path in the `TEMP` or `TMP` environment variable appended with directory paths
`OpenModelica/OMEdit` so the complete path is usually `%TEMP%/OpenModelica/OMEdit`.

All the log files are always generated in the temporary directory.

By default the working directory has the same path as the temporary directory. You can change
the working directory from *Tools > Options > General* see section :ref:`omedit-options-general`.

For each simulation a new directory with the model name is created in the working directory and
then all the simulation intermediate and results files are generated in it.
