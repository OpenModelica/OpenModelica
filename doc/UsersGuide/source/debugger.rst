Debugging
=========

There are two main ways to debug Modelica code, the
:ref:`transformations browser <transformations-browser>`, which shows the
transformations OpenModelica performs on the equations.
There is also a debugger for :ref:`debugging of algorithm sections and functions <algorithm-debugging>`.

.. _transformations-browser :

The Equation-based Debugger
---------------------------

This section gives a short description how to get started using the equation-based debugger in OMEdit.

Enable Tracing Symbolic Transformations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This enables tracing symbolic transformations of equations. It is
optional but strongly recommended in order to fully use the debugger.
The compilation time overhead from having this tracing on is less than
1%, however, in addition to that, some time is needed for the system to
write the xml file containing the transformation tracing information.

Enable -d=infoXmlOperations in Tools->Options->Simulation (see section
:ref:`omedit-options-simulation`) OR alternatively click on the checkbox *Generate operations in
the info xml* in Tools->Options->Debugger (see section :ref:`omedit-options-debugger`) which
performs the same thing.

This adds all the transformations performed by OpenModelica on the
equations and variables stored in the model\_info.xml file. This is
necessary for the debugger to be able to show the whole path from the
source equation(s) to the position of the bug.

Load a Model to Debug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Load an interesting model. We will use the package `Debugging.mo <https://github.com/OpenModelica/OMCompiler/blob/master/Examples/Debugging.mo>`__
since it contains suitable, broken models to demonstrate common errors.

Simulate and Start the Debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select and simulate the model as usual. For example, if using the
Debugging package, select the model
Debugging.Chattering.ChatteringEvents1. If there is an error, you will
get a clickable link that starts the debugger. If the user interface is
unresponsive or the running simulation uses too much processing power,
click cancel simulation first.

  Simulating the model.

Use the Transformation Debugger for Browsing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The debugger opens on the equation where the error was found.
You can browse through the dependencies (variables that
are defined by the equation, or the equation is dependent on), and
similar for variables. The equations and variables form a bipartite
graph that you can walk.

If the -d=infoXmlOperations was used or you clicked the “generate
operations” button, the operations performed on the equations and
variables can be viewed. In the example package, there are not a lot of
operations because the models are small.

Try some larger models, e.g. in the MultiBody library or some other
library, to see more operations with several transformation steps
between different versions of the relevant equation(s). If you do not
trigger any errors in a model, you can still open the debugger, using
File->Open Transformations File (model\_info.json).

The Algorithmic Debugger
------------------------

This section gives a short description how to get started using the
algorithmic debugger in OMEdit. See section :ref:`omedit-options-simulation` for further details
of debugger options.

Adding Breakpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to add the breakpoints,

-  Click directly on the line number in Text View, a red circle is
   created indicating a breakpoint as shown in :numref:`omedit-add-breakpoint`.

-  Open the Algorithmic Debugger window and add a breakpoint using the
   right click menu of Breakpoints Browser window.

  Adding breakpoint in Text View.

Start the Algorithmic Debugger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should add breakpoints before starting the debugger because
sometimes the simulation finishes quickly and you won’t get any chance
to add the breakpoints.

There are four ways to start the debugger,

-  Open the Simulation Setup and click on Launch Algorithmic Debugger
   before pressing Simulate.

-  Right click the model in Libraries Browser and select Simulate with
   Algorithmic Debugger.

-  Open the Algorithmic Debugger window and from menu select
   Debug-> :ref:`omedit-debug-configurations`.

-  Open the Algorithmic Debugger window and from menu select
   Debug-> :ref:`omedit-debug-attach`.

.. _omedit-debug-configurations :

Debug Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a simulation executable with debugging symbols
outside of OMEdit then you can use the Debug->Debug Configurations
option to load it.

The debugger also supports MetaModelica data structures so one can debug
omc executable. Select omc executable as program and write the name of
the mos script file in Arguments.

  Debug Configurations.

.. _omedit-debug-attach :

Attach to Running Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have a running simulation executable with debugging
symbols outside of OMEdit then you can use the Debug->Attach to Running
Process option to attach the debugger with it. :numref:`omedit-attach-to-process` shows the
Attach to Running Process dialog. The dialog shows the list of processes
running on the machine. The user selects the program that he/she wish to
debug. OMEdit debugger attaches to the process.

  Attach to Running Process.

Using the Algorithmic Debugger Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:numref:`omedit-algorithmic-debugger` shows the Algorithmic Debugger window. The window contains
the following browsers,

-  *Stack Frames Browser* – shows the list of frames. It contains the
   program context buttons like resume, interrupt, exit, step over,
   step in, step return. It also contains a threads drop down which
   allows switching between different threads.

-  *BreakPoints Browser* – shows the list of breakpoints. Allows
   adding/editing/removing breakpoints.

-  *Locals Browser* – Shows the list of local variables with values.
   Select the variable and the value will be shown in the bottom
   right window. This is just for convenience because some variables
   might have long values.

-  *Debugger CLI* – shows the commands sent to gdb and their responses.
   This is for advanced users who want to have more control of the
   debugger. It allows sending commands to gdb.

-  *Output Browser* – shows the output of the debugged executable.
