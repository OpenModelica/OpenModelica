OMJulia - OpenModelica Julia Scripting
======================================

OMJulia - the OpenModelica Julia API is a free, open source, 
highly portable Julia based interactive session handler for 
Julia scripting of OpenModelica API functionality. It provides the modeler
with components for creating a complete Julia-Modelica modeling, compilation 
and simulation environment based on the latest OpenModelica implementation 
and Modelica library standard available. OMJulia is architectured to 
combine both the solving strategy and model building.
Thus, domain experts (people writing the models) and computational
engineers (people writing the solver code) can work on one unified tool
that is industrially viable for optimization of Modelica models, while
offering a flexible platform for algorithm development and research.
OMJulia is not a standalone package, it depends upon the 
OpenModelica installation.

OMJulia.jl is implemented in Julia and depends on
ZeroMQ - high performance asynchronous messaging library and it supports the Modelica
Standard Library that is included in OpenModelica 1.9.2.
