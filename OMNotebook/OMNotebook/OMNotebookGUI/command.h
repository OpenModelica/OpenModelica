    * \brief Interface for creating cell commands.
    *
    * Every command will have access to a cursor when executed. This
    * cursor is set by the executing environment.
    *
    * it should probably have access to the document instead. This
    * would give the commands much more usable.
    *
    * \todo Define some atomic commands that could be used to build up
    * more advanced commands. For example move up down. Select cell at
    * cursor position. Add/delete cell and so on. Just so there is a
    * base to work with. Then this could be really powerful. (Ingemar Axelsson)
    *
    * \todo Add a composite command. With composite command and a
    * ifcommand a quite powerful macro environment.(Ingemar Axelsson)

    * \brief Allows composite commands to be created.
    *
    * This is not fully implemented. It is just a template for the
    * composite command.
    *
    * One command could execute a lot of things. Notice that commands
    * are executed in the order that they are added (or see STL
    * vector). This command could be used to make some kind of macro
    * of other commands. It seems to be very powerful.
