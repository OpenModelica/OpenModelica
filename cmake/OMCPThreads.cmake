# This little ugly hack allows us to use linux pthreads and Window's
# PThreads4W library interchangeably without having to put if-else
# checks everywhere.
# It will  use either CMake's own Threads package or, if we are building for MSVC, will use PThreads4W from
# local installation (e.g vcpkg managed)

# If you want to use PThreads no matter the OS (even on Windows like
# 3rdParty/GC and our runtime libraries do) just link to OMCPThreads::OMCPThreads
# anywhere in OpenModelica since this file will be included in the top
# level CMakeLists.txt.
