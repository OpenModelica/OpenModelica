 ** Connections generate connection sets which are constructed during

 ** create a number of equations.
 **
 ** This module performs connection set management.

 ** - Adding
 **
 ** The two relations `add_eq' and `add_flow' addes a variable to a
 ** connection set.  The first relation is used to add a non-flow
 ** variable, and the second is used to add a flow variable.  When
 ** two component are to be added to a collection of connection sets,
 ** the connections sets containg the components have to be located.
 ** If no such set exists, a new set containing only the new component
 ** is created.
 **
 ** If the connection sets containing the two components are not the
 ** same, they are merged.
 **)

relation add_equ : (Sets, Exp.ComponentRef, Exp.ComponentRef) => Sets =

  rule	find_equ_set(ss,r1) => s1 &
	find_equ_set(ss,r2) => s2 &
	merge(ss,s1,s2) => ss'
	----------------------
	add_equ(ss,r1,r2) => ss'
	
end

(**)

relation add_flow : (Sets, Exp.ComponentRef, Face, Exp.ComponentRef, Face)
	  => Sets =

  rule	find_flow_set(ss,r1,d1) => s1 &
	find_flow_set(ss,r2,d2) => s2 &

 ** - Equation generation
 **)

(** relation: equations
 **
 ** From a number of connection sets, this relation generates a list
 ** of equations.

end

(** relation: equ_equations
 ** 
 ** A non-flow connection set contains a number of components.
 ** Generating the equation from this set means equating all the
 ** components.  For n components, this will give n-1 equations.
 **
 ** For example, if the set contains the components `x', `y.a' and
 ** `z.b', the equations generated will me `x = y.a' and `y.a = z.b'.
 **)

(** relation: flow_equations
 ** 
 ** Generating equations from a flow connection set is a little
 ** trickier that from a non-flow set.  Only one equation is
 ** generated, but it has to consider whether the comoponents were
 ** inner or outer connectors.
 **
 ** This relation uses `flow_sum' to create the sum of all components
 ** (some of which will be negated), and the returns the equation
 ** where this sum is equal to 0.0.
 **)

end

(** relation: flow_sum
 ** 
 ** This relation creates an exression expressing the sum of all
 ** components in the given list.  Before adding the component to the
 ** sum, it is passed to `sign_flow' which will negate all outer
 ** connectors.

end

(** relation: sign_flow
 **
 ** This relation takes a name of a component and a `Face', returns an
 ** expression.  If the face is `INNER' the expression simply contains
 ** the component reference, but if it is `OUTER', the expression is
 ** negated.
