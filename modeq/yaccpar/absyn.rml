 ** description: Abstract syntax
 **
 ** RCS: $Id$
 **
 ** This file defines the abstract syntax for Modelica in RML.  It mainly
 ** contains datatypes for constructing the abstract syntax tree
 ** (AST), relations for building and altering RML datatypes and a few relations 
 ** for printing the AST.
 **  
 ** absyn.rml's constructors are primarily used by the walker 
 ** (modeq/absyn_builder/walker.g) which takes an ANTLR internal syntax tree and
 ** converts it into an RML abstract syntax tree.
 **
 ** When the AST has been built, it is normaly used by explode.rml in order to
 ** build the scode (See explode.rml). It is also possile to send the AST do 
 ** the dumper (dump.rml) in order to print it.
 ** 
 ** For details regarding the abstract syntax tree, check out the grammar in 
 ** the Modelica language specification.
