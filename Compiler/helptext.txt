plot(var) -                   Plot a variable relative to time from the most recently 
                              simulated model.
                              Ex: plot(x)

plot(vars) -                  Plot variables given as a vector relative to time from 
                              the most recently simulated model 
                              Ex: plot({x,y})

plotParametric(vars) -        Plot variables relative to the first variable in the
                              argument vector.
                              Ex: plot({x,y,z })
                              (Plotting y and z as functions of x)

readFile(str) -               Load file given as string and return a string of the
                              file content.
                              Ex: readFile("myModel/myModelr.mo")

readSimulationResultSize(strFile) - 
                              Return the size of the record resulting from a simulation
			            The size is read from the result file, given as a string
                              Ex:  readSimulationResultSize("dcmotor_res.plt");

readSimulationResult(strFile, variables, size) - 
                              Read the results of a simulation from a file named by
                              the string argument strFile. 
			            Here size is the size of the resulting record and
			            variables is a vector of the variables to investigate.
                              Ex: readSimulationResult("dcmotor_res.plt", {R1.i,L1.v}, 10)

runScript(strFile) -          Exectute script file (.mos) given as string argument.
                              Ex: runScript("simulation.mos")

saveModel(strFile,modelname) - Save the model/class with name modelname in the
                              file given by the strFile string argument.

simulate(modelname[,startTime=<Real>][,stopTime=<Real>][,numberOfIntervals=<Integer>])
                              Translates a model and simulates it.
                              Ex: simulate(dcmotor)
                              Ex: simulate(dcmotor,startTime=0, stopTime=10,
                                           numberOfIntervals=1000)

                              success value.
                              Ex: system("touch myFile")


timing(expr) -                Evaluates expression and returns the number of
                              seconds the evaluation took.
                              Ex: timing(x*4711+5)

typeOf(variable) -            Returns the type of the variable as a string.
                              Ex: typeOf(R1.v)
