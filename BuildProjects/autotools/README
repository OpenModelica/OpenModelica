For more detailed installation instructions:
./autogen.sh (generates the project)
less INSTALL
# Default: Build only shared library with as much included as possible. Adds static zlib if not found in the system.
./configure
# To add static libraries (not as compatible)
./configure --enable-static
# For a static library similar to the Windows build
./configure --disable-hdf5 --enable-static-zlib --enable-static --disable-shared --libdir=/path/to/Modelica/Resources/Library/linux64
make
sudo make install
sudo make uninstall

Note that special care has to be taken if there is a space in the path (e.g. /path/to/Modelica 3.2.1/Resources/Library/linux32).
GNU tools, libtool in particular, cannot handle paths with spaces in them (which is one of the reasons you should never install MinGW in a path with spaces).
In this case, there are two main workarounds:
* Temporarily move the directory to one without spaces, and moving it back after make install.
* Manually copying the files instead of make install: cp .libs/* ../Library/linux32

Minimal files needed to compile on Unix (requires autotools installed):
 autogen.sh, configure.ac, Makefile.am, README
