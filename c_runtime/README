OpenModelica runtime libraries
==============================

This directory contains files for the Modelica runtime
environment. The runtime consists of two libraries, libc_runtime.a and
libsim.a. 

libc_runtime.a
==============
c_runtime is used for executing Modelica functions that has been
generated C code for. It consists of the following files.

boolean_array.*   - how arrays of booleans are represented in C.
integer_array.*   - how arrays of integers are represented in C.
real_array.*	  - how arrays of reals are represented in C.
string_array.*    - how arrays of strings are represented in C.
index_spec.c      - keep track of dimension sizes of arrays.
memory_pool.c	  - memory allocation for local variables.
read_write.*	  - reading and writing of data to file.
utility.*	      - utility functions
modelica_string.* - string functions


libsim.a
========
libsim.a is the runtime for simulations, it contains solvers and a
main function for the simulation. The following files are included:

simulation_runtime.* 	- Includes the main function and calls to solvers.
tables.*                - implementation for tables omcTableTimeIni, etc
solver_dasrt.*          - wrapper for 
daux.f 			- auxilary Fortran functions
ddasrt.f		- DDASRT solver
ddassl.f		- DASSL solver
dlamch.f		- determine machine parameters for solvers
dlinpk.f		- gaussian elimination routines, used by solvers.
lsame.f			- LAPACK axuiliary routine LSAME.
