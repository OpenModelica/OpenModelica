OpenModelica Builtin Commands
-----------------------------
Exit OMShell by pressing Ctrl-d

 up-arrow
          Get previously given command.
 down-arrow
          Get next command.

 <tab>
          Command completion of these builtin commands.
          Circulate through the commands by only using <tab>.

 cd()
          Return the current directory

 cd(dir)
          Change directory to the directory given as a string.
          Ex: cd("myModels/myLibrary")

 clear()
          Clear everything.

 clearVariables()
          Clear the variables.

 help()
          Print this helptext (returned as a string).

 instantiateModel(modelname)
          Instantiates a model/class and returns a string
          containing the flat class definition.
          Ex: instantiateModel(dcmotor)
 list()
          Return a string containing all class definitions.

 list(modelname)
          Return a string containing the class definition of
          the named class. Ex: list(dcmotor)

 listVariables()
          Return a vector of the currently defined variable names.

 loadFile(strFile)
          Load modelica file given as string argument.
          Ex: loadFile("../myLibrary/myModels.mo")

 loadModel(name)
          Load model, function, or package relative to $OPENMODELICALIBRARY.
          Ex: loadModel(Modelica.Electrical)
          Note: if e.g. loadModel(Modelica) fails, you may have
          OPENMODELICALIBRARY pointing at the wrong location.

 plot(var)
          Plot a variable relative to time from the most recently
          simulated model. Ex: plot(x)

 plot(vars)
          Plot variables given as a vector relative to time from
          the most recently simulated model.
          Plotting parameters, array elements or record variables not
          currently supported.
          Ex: plot({x,y})

 plotParametric(var1, var2)
          Plot var2 relative to var1 from the most recently
          simulated model.
          Ex: plotParametric(x,y)

 readFile(str)
          Load file given as string and return a string of the file content.
          Ex: readFile("myModel/myModelr.mo")

 readSimulationResultSize(strFile)
          Return the size of the record resulting from a simulation. The size
          is read from the result file, given as a string
          Ex:  readSimulationResultSize("dcmotor_res.plt");

 readSimulationResult(strFile, variables, size)
          Read the results of a simulation from a file named by the string
          argument strFile. Here size is the size of the resulting record and
	      variables is a vector of the variables to investigate.
          Ex: readSimulationResult("dcmotor_res.plt", {R1.i,L1.v}, 10)

 runScript(strFile)
          Exectute script file (.mos) given as string argument.
          Ex: runScript("simulation.mos")

 saveModel(strFile,modelname)
          Save the model/class with name modelname in the file given by the
          strFile string argument.

 simulate(modelname[,startTime=<Real>]
          [,stopTime=<Real>][,numberOfIntervals=<Integer>])
          Translates a model and simulates it.
          Ex: simulate(dcmotor)
          Ex: simulate(dcmotor,startTime=0, stopTime=10, numberOfIntervals=1000)

 system(str)
          Execute str as a system(shell) command, return integer success value.
          Ex: system("touch myFile")

 timing(expr)
          Evaluates expression and returns the number of seconds the evaluation
          took. Ex: timing(x*4711+5)

 typeOf(variable)
          Returns the type of the variable as a string. Ex: typeOf(R1.v)

 val(variableName,stime)
          The val(variableName,time) scription function retrieves the interpolated
          value of a simulation result variable at time=stime of the
            simulated time.
          Using val on parameters, array elements, or record variables not
          currently supported.

 quit()
          Leave OpenModelica and kill the process.
